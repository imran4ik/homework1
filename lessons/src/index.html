    <p>It took me a long time to learn where he came from. The little prince, who asked me so many questions, never seemed to hear the ones I asked him. It was from words dropped by chance that, little by little, everything was revealed to me. <br><br> The first time he saw my airplane, for instance (I shall not draw my airplane; that would be much too complicated for me), he asked me </p>

    <br>
    <p>
        "What is that object?"
    <br> <br>
        "That is not an object. It flies. It is an airplane. It is my airplane."
    <br> <br>
        And I was proud to have him learn that I could fly.
    <br> <br>
    He cried out, then:
    <br><br>
    "What! You dropped down from the sky?"
    <br> <br>
    "Yes," I answered, modestly.
    <br> <br>
    "Oh! That is funny!"
    <br> <br>
    And the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter, which irritated me very much. I like my misfortunes to be taken seriously.
    <br> <br>
    Then he added:
    <br> <br>
    "So you, too, come from the sky! Which is your planet?"
    <br> <br>
    At that moment I caught a gleam of light in the impenetrable mystery of his presence; and I demanded, abruptly:
    <br> <br>
    "Do you come from another planet?"
    <br> <br>
    But he did not reply. He tossed his head gently, without taking his eyes from my plane:
    <br> <br>
    "It is true that on that you can't have come from very far away..."
    <br> <br>
    And he sank into a reverie, which lasted a long time. Then, taking my sheep out of his pocket, he buried himself in the contemplation of his treasure.
    <br> <br>
    You can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this half-confidence about the "other planets." I made a great effort, therefore, to find out more on this subject.
    <br> <br>
    "My little man, where do you come from? What is this 'where I live,' of which you speak? Where do you want to take your sheep?"
    <br> <br>
    After a reflective silence he answered:
    <br> <br>
    "The thing that is so good about the box you have given me is that at night he can use it as his house."
    <br> <br>
    "That is so. And if you are good I will give you a string, too, so that you can tie him during the day, and a post to tie him to."
    <br> <br>
     But the little prince seemed shocked by this offer:
    </p>

    <p>
     "Tie him! What a queer idea!"
    <br> <br>
     "But if you don't tie him," I said, "he will wander off somewhere, and get lost."
     <br> <br>
     My friend broke into another peal of laughter:
     <br> <br>
     "But where do you think he would go?"
     <br> <br>
     "Anywhere. Straight ahead of him."
     <br> <br>
     Then the little prince said, earnestly:
     <br> <br>
     "That doesn't matter. Where I live, everything is so small!"
     <br> <br>
     And, with perhaps a hint of sadness, he added:
     <br> <br>
     "Straight ahead of him, nobody can go very far..."
